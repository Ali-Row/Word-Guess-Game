# Word-Guess-Game
This is my version of the game hangman, I made this while attending the University of Richmond's Coding Bootcamp.

The game is very simple, you have to guess the word correctly before you run out of guesses, you keyboard input is grabbed by default so all you have to do is type! Good luck!
